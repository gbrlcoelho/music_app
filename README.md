# Music App

This music app was developed as part of the "Flutter Dicas Bootcamp" course. It is built with Flutter, a popular framework for developing cross-platform mobile applications. The app allows users to browse and listen to music from different genres. It utilizes several dependencies to provide a smooth and interactive user experience. The app also communicates with a simulated API server to retrieve music data.

## Dependencies

- **flutter:** The Flutter SDK is required for developing and running Flutter applications.
- **get:** A package that simplifies navigation and state management in Flutter applications.
- **dio:** A powerful HTTP client for making API requests in Dart.
- **dartz:** A functional programming package that provides algebraic data types and utility functions.
- **audioplayers:** A Flutter plugin for playing audio files.
- **flutter_dotenv:** A package for reading environment variables from a `.env` file.

## API Simulation

For simulating the API, you can use `jserver`, a tool that serves static JSON files as an API. Follow the steps below to run the API server:

1. Install `jserver` globally by running `npm install -g jserver`.
2. Create a JSON file (e.g., `api.json`) and copy the provided JSON into it.
3. Run the following command to start the API server:

jserver -h `YOUR_IP` -p 8080 -d api.json

Replace `YOUR_IP` with the IP address of your machine or the desired IP address where the API server should be accessible.

Note: Make sure to keep the API server running while using the music app.

## Environment Configuration

To configure the app to communicate with the simulated API server, you need to set the `API_BASE_URL` environment variable in a `.env` file. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following line:

API_BASE_URL="http://`YOUR_IP`:8080"

Replace `YOUR_IP` with the same IP address used when starting the API server.

## Important Information

- The music app provides two genres: "Ambiente" and "Eletr√¥nico".
- Each genre contains a list of music tracks with their respective details.
- The app relies on the provided JSON file for music data.
- Images for genres and music tracks are located in the `assets/images` directory.
- Music files are stored in the `musics` directory.

Feel free to explore and modify the app according to your requirements. Happy coding!
